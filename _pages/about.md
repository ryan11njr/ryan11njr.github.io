Welcome to my personal website. I am a junior student majoring in Intelligent Transportation Systems Engineering at Tongji University, specializing in Traffic Information and Control Engineering, and expected to graduate in July,2025.

I am currently in the process of seeking a Master's program for the 2025 intake（我有保研资格）, with my interests spanning across a diverse range of fields including Transportation, Urban Planning, Statistics and Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and more. While my interests are broad, I am also a very dedicated individual with a strong spirit of in-depth exploration and research.

As evident from my academic background, my undergraduate major is in Transportation Engineering. However, my coursework has been quite diverse, encompassing not only transportation-related courses but also foundational courses in electronic technology, signals and systems, principles of information transmission, and automatic control principles. I view the undergraduate stage as a crucial period for cultivating learning and research capabilities. Regardless of the specific field I will delve into for future research, I am fully capable of self-learning and getting up to speed within a span of two months, post which I can immediately embark on research. 

On my website, you can find my English resume on the CV page, and my Chinese resume is included on the 中文简介 page. The Blog page contains introductions to some of the projects I have done and shares of study notes, and the Reports & Homeworks page shares all my current course reports and major assignments for reference. I hope my website can help you get to know me better. 

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me. Thank you for visiting my website!
